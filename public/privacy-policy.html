  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 2025</p>

  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>
    We take privacy as seriously as you do. This policy shows how and why we collect, use, share, 
    and manage your personal information ("info"). It also explains how we store and secure that info, 
    and how you can check and control the personal info we hold about you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any time you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>use our websites, or</li>
    <li>enter into an agreement with us through them, or</li>
    <li>subscribe to our services,</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    we’ll take it that you have read and agreed to what’s in this policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    We update this policy as we need to, to make sure it’s always current. 
    We encourage you to review it now and then, so that you know of any changes. 
    We’ll take your continued use of our websites and apps as acceptance of our revised privacy policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    In this policy, “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to FreeOZBBS and our related businesses.
    We run this website (including desktop, mobile, tablet, or any apps):
  </p>
  <p><strong>https://www.freeozbbs.com</strong></p>
  <p>
    In this policy, we’ll refer to this website (and any related mobile sites or apps) as the “websites”.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Respect Information Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    We understand the importance of protecting your personal information. Whenever we collect 
    and handle personal info, we aim to do so in compliance with applicable privacy laws and 
    principles. 
    <!-- If you need to specify particular laws, e.g. Australian Privacy Act, GDPR, etc., add them here. -->
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect, How We Use It, and How We Disclose It</h2>
  <p>
    The kinds of things you do on our websites might mean we need to collect your personal information. 
    If you want us to send you emails, for example, we’ll need your email address. Often, you’ll know 
    what info we’re collecting because you give it to us directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    We might also collect non-personal information (e.g., the pages you look at on our websites) 
    to give you a more helpful, personal experience. For example, we may use cookies or other 
    technology to suggest content related to what you view most often. You might not always realize 
    when it’s happening, but by using our sites, you consent to such collection.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using our sites, you agree only to ever give us:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>your own personal information, or</li>
    <li>personal info that someone has agreed for you to share, 
        e.g. a referee in a registration form.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We’ll only ever use or share your information for the purpose you gave it to us or for something 
    closely related to that. For example, if you sign up for a newsletter about community updates, 
    we might also show you relevant forum articles when you visit our websites.
  </p>
